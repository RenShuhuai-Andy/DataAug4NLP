# Adding a new entry

Format your paper as the following:

| Paper |  Dataset |
| -- | -- | 
| Best data augmentation technique [(ACL '27)](https://github.com/styfeng/DataAug4NLP/) [code](https://github.com/styfeng/DataAug4NLP/) |  GLUE |

Specifically:

- Only include the title of the paper.
- Capitalize all important words in the title.
- Include the conference in parenthesis, with a link to the paper. Use ACL Anthology if possible. Abbreviate if it's a workshop paper. You could also use the arxiv link (e.g., for AAAI, this might be a good idea). If your paper is arxiv-only, just put 'arxiv'.
- Use '27 instead of 2027. 
- Include the code if you have it.
- Add the papers chronologically. 

The only exception to this format is if your paper title is not about data augmentation, but it is well-known for doing data augmentation. 
This should follow the first example under text classification called `Synonym Replacement`.
